# Yosemite Camp 4 Bouldering Video Guide

## Hosting

Website is hosted via Github Pages, at [www.camp4bouldering.com](http://www.camp4bouldering.com)

The `master` branch is the production branch, and is automatically made live.

### So we don't commit directly to `master`, instead we follow a simple deployment process

## Deployment

We use [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/chalkprints/chalkprints.github.io) to automagically run our [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) tasks:

1. Concat and minify the CSS and JS
- Create a new `index.html`
- Execute some tests

The CI processes are run on the `deploy` branch. If all goes well, the `deploy` branch is updated with the autogenerated files. Then, it is merged into `master` and it is all taken live. Wallah!

## Development

1. Create your own branch, off the `deploy` branch
- Do your stuffs
- Merge back into `deploy` or, better yet, use a PR

Wait for a bit. Travis-CI will run on code in the `deploy` branch. In a few min, your stuffs will be live.


## TODO

Can't get Travis-CI to push to Github. Boohoo.
